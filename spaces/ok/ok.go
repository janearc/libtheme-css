// The numbers.
//
// The conversion above is two steps, and the two steps are the whole
// idea. First, XYZ is turned into how strongly each of the eye's three
// cone types would respond, called LMS for long, medium and short
// wavelength. XYZ was built in 1931 to be non-negative, not to be cones;
// this matrix undoes that choice. Then each response has its cube root
// taken: the eye reports ratios, not amounts, so doubling the light does
// not look like twice as much, and a cube root is the compression that
// matches what people report. Last, the three compressed responses are
// combined into one lightness and two opponent axes, because an eye
// cannot see a reddish green or a bluish yellow, and those pairs are
// what it actually compares.
//
// The nine numbers in each forward matrix are fitted, not derived: Björn
// Ottosson chose them in 2020 by searching for the values under which
// hue stays put when lightness changes and equal steps look equal,
// against published measurements of what people see. They are the ones
// from his description of the space, https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/,
// and CSS Color Level 4 adopted them unchanged. A fit has no derivation
// to show, only reference values to check, and the tests check them. The
// inverses are computed, so the only typed numbers are the fit.
//
// His name is not "ok", by the way. It's Björn. He just goes by ok
// online.
