// Colourway is what a colourway file holds once read: its roles, every
// custom property that is a hex colour, in file order, and its ramps,
// which are numbered families of roles: --sunset-1 to --sunset-6 is an
// even ramp called sunset. That is the whole grammar, and it is ours:
// a sheet this library wrote, or a colourway written by hand in the
// same shape. Anything else in the file, selectors, gradients, the
// rest of css, is not read. This is a container, not a parser; a file
// that wants a ramp read promotes its stops to roles, as the
// vaporwave file does. Ramps mix in oklab, the library's line between
// two colours, which is said here so nobody is surprised.
