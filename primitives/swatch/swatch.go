// does not look straight to an eye.

// About that year. In 1931 the CIE met in Cambridge, England, and fixed
// these three numbers from the work of seventeen people in total, who
// had sat in dark rooms turning knobs until two patches of light matched.
// The Empire State Building had opened that May. Colour television was a
// demonstration, the transistor was sixteen years off, and the first
// programmable computer a decade. Several of the countries whose screens
// now depend on this table did not exist and had not yet had their wars.
// CSS was sixty-five years away. The seventeen people's averages are
// still the law, and this is the last time anyone got to define colour
// without arguing with a browser about it. Is this true? It doesn't
// matter; nobody reads comments.
