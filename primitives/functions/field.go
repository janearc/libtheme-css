// How the maths becomes a picture.
//
// Think of the surface being painted as a square sheet, one unit on a
// side. Every cell on the screen is a point on that sheet: u says how far
// across, v how far down, both from 0 to 1. Painting the sheet is two
// separate questions, asked once per cell:
//
//	1. What number does this point get?      (a Field: position to t)
//	2. What colour does that number get?      (a Ramp: t to a swatch)
//
// A Field answers the first. It is any rule that takes u and v and gives
// back a t between 0 and 1. Nothing more: no colour, no cells, no idea
// which ramp it will feed. The Ramp answers the second and never learns
// where the number came from. The cell is painted with ramp.At(field.T(u,
// v)), and that expression is what a gradient is. There is no gradient
// type, because a gradient is those two things put together, and keeping
// them apart is what lets one ramp paint a sun, a sky and a stripe.
//
// The rules that come with the package are the three shapes everyone
// knows, and they are examples, not the limit:
//
//	Linear   the number grows along a direction, 0 at one end, 1 at the
//	         other. bands.
//	Radial   the number is the distance from a centre, 0 there and 1 at a
//	         radius. rings. a sun is this.
//	Conic    the number is the angle around a centre, 0 at the top and
//	         back to 1 after a full turn. a colour wheel.
//	Through  any of the above seen through a matrix: the sheet is
//	         squashed or turned before the rule reads it, so rings
//	         become ellipses and bands tilt.
//
// A Field is a container for a rule, not an enforcer of a geometry. Any
// function of u and v is one; Func below lets you write one inline. So
// a shape none of the three describe is still a field. An egg is a
// radial whose radius depends on the direction from the centre, larger
// below than above. Ripples on its lower half are the same egg with a
// small wave added to t as the distance grows, only where v is past the
// centre. Both are a few lines with math.Atan2 and math.Sin, both are
// still position-to-t, and the ramp that colours them is the same ramp
// that coloured the sun. If a shape needs a new rule, write the rule;
// nothing here has to change.
//
// Time is not a coordinate of the sheet. An animation is one ramp and a
// field per frame, where the frame's time was folded into the field
// when it was built: a centre that moves, a wave that has advanced.

// Field is a rule from a position on the surface, u and v in 0..1, to a
// t in 0..1.

// screen.

// Linear is the number growing along the axis from A to B: 0 at A, 1 at
// B, held beyond either end. The maths is a projection, a dot product
// with the axis divided by its length squared, which is the same thing

// Radial is the distance from a centre divided by a radius: 0 at the
// centre, 1 at the radius and beyond. Rings. A sun is this with the
// centre low on the sheet. The sheet is square; if the cells it is drawn
// on are not, the caller corrects the position first or the rings are
// ovals. For rings that are not circles on purpose, see the note at the

// Through is a field seen through a matrix. The position is moved before

// M[1][1]*y, for x and y measured from the centre. The identity matrix,
