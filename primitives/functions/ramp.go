// Package functions holds the things that turn a number into a swatch.
// The name is general on purpose: a ramp is a function of one number, t
// from 0 to 1, and there may be others. They are built from swatches and
// a way of blending them, and nothing else, which is why they sit under
// primitives and import no space.
//
// The seam. Where t comes from is not this library's business. A ramp
// answers "what colour is t" and never asks "which cell is this, how far
// from the centre, what time is it". Those are geometry, and geometry
// belongs to whatever is drawing: a canvas, a strip of lamps, a bar of
// hours. It hands the ramp a t; the ramp hands back a swatch. That is the
// whole contract, and it is what lets a sun, a sky and a stripe share one
// ramp without this library knowing what a sun is. This library is
// containers, not form.
