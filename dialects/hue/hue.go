// Package hue is the philips hue dialect: how a hue lamp names a colour,
// and how that becomes a swatch and comes back. A hue lamp never says a
// colour. It says a place on the horseshoe, a chromaticity, or a colour
// temperature in mirek, and separately how bright, as a percent that is
// the lamp's own scale and not a luminance. A gradient lamp says five
// places in order along itself. The dialect turns each of those into
// swatches at unit luminance and a list of them into a ramp; the reverse
// samples a ramp back to as many places as a lamp has. Brightness is not
// translated here: it is a law between a leader and a follower, and it
// lives with them. Chromaticities and gamuts are swatch's, not hue's;
// what is hue's is mirek, the places along a lamp, and the three
// gamuts its lamps report by letter.
